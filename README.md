# Foodar

Foodar is a sample food delivery website. It contains a home page, and about page, and a registration page. The title links to the home page. The home page contains an introduction with a zipcode search feature. After loading, an advertisement will pop up after five seconds. A button on the top right corner closes the ad, with it's small size to make the advertisement realistic. Hovering over the images of food will reveal discount code coupons. The about page links to the registration page and contains descriptions of Foodar. The registration page returns the user back to the home page upon successfully registering through the form. The footer contains a navbar to each page of the website. It also contains links to the privacy information and terms of service, the pages themselves to be implemented at a later date.
